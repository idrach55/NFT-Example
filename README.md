# NFT-Example
My first foray into web3: very small NFT project consisting of react front-end and ethereum smart contract.

## react-site
Project built from create-react-app for front-end site.
* wired up to metamask in client's browser and Alchemy API
* mint example contract

## contract
Project built from hardhat for smart contract.
* messing around with example token
* (todo) write more tests and get them to execute successfully on local node
